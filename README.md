# Perlin Noise Generator
This is based on my [Game-of-Life](https://pages.github.com/) repo. Implemented Perlin Noise from scratch, going to try to evolve this into a terrain generator.

Same 4 Layers of Perlin Noise from 2D Screenshot(below) used to offset height of flat plane. Positive heights are green, negative heights are blue.

Perlin Noise colored with some trig functions, from the [2D-Noise](https://github.com/gusjengis/Perlin-Noise-Generator/tree/2D-Noise) branch.

4 Layers of Perlin Noise colored in the same way, from the [2D-Noise](https://github.com/gusjengis/Perlin-Noise-Generator/tree/2D-Noise) branch.
